# Modulus Inutilus

Pretty simple, the ciphertextis pretty small and is is much larger so n doesn't have a effect on ciphertext.

Since e=3 and the rsa equation is ct=m^e mod n, where m^e<n, so ct=m^e

So m=pow(ct,-e) and tehn convert it into bytes and the flag should come

  # Flag

  crypto{N33d_m04R_p4dd1ng}
