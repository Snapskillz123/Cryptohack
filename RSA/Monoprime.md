# Monoprime

Using the data in the text file i ran this data on https://www.dcode.fr/rsa-cipher to check what comes out and it told me that n was prime.
So that mean p=n and q=1 or vice versa. So i modified my code from the previous question to suit n being prime because (p-1)*(q-1) would be zero and and error would come about.
