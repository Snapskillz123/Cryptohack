# JSON WEB TOKEN

After learning the format of the web token, using the man pages of pyjwt, i made a code to decode the web token and give a suitable output, but an error came which i was unable to understand even after going online.

So instead i used an online tool for getting the data stored in the JWT and got the flag.
